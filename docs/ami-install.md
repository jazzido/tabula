# Tabula EC2 AMI

An Amazon EC2 AMI image is provided to give you a chance to boot up a quick
test server: `ami-e895f081`

## Caveats

Note the [EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
and [EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/). We’re not responsible
for any costs this may incur.

Also, please note that this image is a development demo image and may not be
secure. Using this AMI for mission-critical or sensitive documents is currently
not recommended.

## Quick Start

If you've got an Amazon AWS account and have EC2 enabled, here's how you
boot up an instance with our AMI:

1. Visit [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/), click on "AWS Management
   Console" (under "My Account/Console"), and log in:

2. Click on the "EC2" section and press the "Launch Instance" button. From
   here, you should be presented with this menu (click on "Quick Launch Wizard"
   on the left if you’re on one of the other options):

3. Select the SSH keypair you want to use, and make sure you have "More Amazon
   Machine Images" selected, then click "Continue".

4. Under the "Public AMIs" tab, type `ami-e895f081` into the search box. If no AMIs are found, make sure your region is set to US East (N. Virginia).

5. Click "Continue". Optionally change the server type by clicking "Edit
   details". (Note the [EC2 instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
   and [EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/).
   Tabula takes about a 60 seconds to process a short document (<10 pages)
   on the Micro and Small instances.)

   Go ahead and launch the server.

6. While the server’s booting up, you’ll need to open up port 80. Note the
   "Security Group" that your new server is using, then click on the "Security
   Groups" option in the lefthand sidebar.

7. Select the security group associated with your server, then click on the
   "Inbound" tab in the lower panel. Create a new rule for "HTTP", then press
   "Add Rule" and then "Apply Rule Changes".

   You should then notice the "80 (HTTP) --- 0.0.0.0/0" service listed in the
   table on the right.

8. Click on "Instances" in the sidebar, and click on your newly-launched
   instance. Underneath the instance’s identifier, you’ll see a domain name
   such as "ec2-123-123-123-123.compute-1.amazonaws.com".

   Open that web address in your browser. If it doesn’t come up right away,
   try again in a minute ro so. (If you continue to have issues, double-check
   the status of that instance in your "Instances" page.)
